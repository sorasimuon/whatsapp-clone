# Whats App Clone ( Front End )

Demo Link : https://whatsapp-clone-fd533.firebaseapp.com/

Credential tests: 

username : "user1@email.com", "user2@email.com"

password: "test", "test2"

It is a very simple chat platform where the user can :
  - Register and login with his own credentials
  - Chat with the other registered users
  
This Frontend calls an API called 'whatsapp-backend' written with Node.js, Express.js to retrieve user information and conversations history in MongoDB (https://github.com/sorasimuon/whatsapp-backend)
